# F2DNet reproduction
This [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02331.pdf) was reproduced as part of the project in CS4245 course in TU Delft CS Masters.

You can find the original GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/AbdulHannanKhan/F2DNet).

We aim to reproduce the results independently, without use of the original code.

### Steps
1. Download the CityPersons dataset
   - The structure should be as shown below

```bash
├── datasets

│         └── anno_val.mat
│     └── images
│         ├── train
│         ├── val
│         └── test
